# Large Scale Benchmarking

**Introduction**

One way functions can be used to calculate simulations of chemical reactions in a setting using a personal laptop by giving probabilistic approximations to the process when resource intensive computations aren't accessible. 


State-Averaged Complete Active-Space Self-Consistent Field

Complete Active Space

\*core, always hold two electrons
\*active, partially occupied orbitals
\*virtual, always hold zero electrons

Self, Consistent Field

Iterative Method that involves selecting an approximate Hamiltonian, solving the Shrodinger equation to obtain a more accurate set of orbitals, and then solving the Shrodinger equation again with theses until the results converge.
